    please make code for me after read this document of specification .

    in Input Table , you can read files  in described in "input file location".
    until not,  I maded spec to Step1-2.

    there is currently function before I created. but it i ok if you remove this functions
    before generate code , please read csv files in declared in  Input Tables.
    In this case, don't read all csv file. just read 10 line. Because this is possible block sending large file data.
    But this is applicable when you read file .  when genrating code, in code block, please read all file.


    please generate function in detail steps in this document described in "Flow Summary".    
    if there is Step1 , and there is Step1-1 , and there is Step1-2, please generate function in detail steps in this document.
    And, if there is function related to Step1-1 aleady , please modify it. and if there is not function related to Step1-1 , please generate new function related to Step1-1.
    And, if there is function related to Step1-2 aleady , please modify it. and if there is not function related to Step1-2 , please generate function related to Step1-2.
    And go to next step as what I said.

    I described "dataframe name" in detail steps in detail steps . 
    If "dataframe name" is df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week, in this case  call script is like below.
    
    ################################################################################################################
    # Step 2  : Step1의 Result에 Time을 Partial Week 으로 변환
    ################################################################################################################
    dict_log = {
        'p_step_no': 20,
        'p_step_desc': 'Step 2  : Step1의 Result에 Time을 Partial Week 으로 변환 '
    }
    df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week = fn_step02_convert_date_to_partial_week(df_01_joined_rts_eos, **dict_log)
    fn_check_input_table(df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week, 'df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week', '0')
    # print for test  
    output_dataframes["df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week"] = df_step01_2_convert_date_to_partial_week

    if step is 01_2 then , 'p_step_no' is 102.
    
    if there is description in Flow Summary like "당주 주차부터 8주 구간에 대해",
    in this case, I will use function common.gfn_add_weeek .   and apply like below.
        common.gfn_add_week(current_week_normalized, 7)
    because 8주 include this week.
    if there is description like "제외하고" or "Except", in this case, I will use function common.gfn_add_weeek .   and apply like below.
        common.gfn_add_week(current_week_normalized, 8)
    because 8주 exclude this week.
